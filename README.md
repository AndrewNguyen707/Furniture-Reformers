# Furniture-Reformers

We developed an app to address the problems of inappropriate furniture disposal and the restricted availability of reasonably priced furniture alternatives in our neighborhood. It makes use of generative AI to produce an approachable website that enables people to choose their furniture with knowledge.

Our prototype aims to:
- Direct users to local resources where they can find similar furniture at a reasonable price.
- Connect users with donation centers or removal services based on location and furniture need.
- Direct users to online marketplaces suitable for selling their furniture.
- Suggest tips and guides on used furniture repairs with the use of computer vision.

1. Acquiring Furniture:
   - User-Friendly: I incorporated a drop-down menu on the type of furniture that the user wants to buy.
   - Interactive: Depending on the type of furniture chosen, a user will be provided with text generation and an interactive map.

2. Dispose Furniture:
   - Delivery: I ensured the application delivers reliable accurate data based on the user's disposal method selection.
   - AI-Powered Suggestions: I provided a drop-down menu on the type of furniture that needs to be disposed of with an interactive map pinpointing locations.
   - Marketplace Guidance: If users were to sell, the web application suggests marketplaces online through text generation.
   - Disposal: I gathered data that if users were to choose to dispose of furniture, an organization's phone number with a website link would appear.

3. Extend Furniture Lifespan:
   - Image Recognition: Integrating computer vision, the application analyzes uploaded furniture images to determine their condition.
   - Personalized Suggestions: We ensured the website uses AI-powered text generation with prompt engineering to recommend maintenance guides or repair instructions based on the furniture condition.


Our goal:

"Furniture Reformers" wants to be your one-stop store for anything about furniture. The initiative helps the community adopt a more sustainable attitude to furniture consumption by supporting appropriate disposal, encouraging furniture reuse, and extending furniture lifespans. Furthermore, it gives consumers the tools and information they need to make wise furniture selections, which empowers them.
